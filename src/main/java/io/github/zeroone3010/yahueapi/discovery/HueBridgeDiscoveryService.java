   * <p>As some discovery methods may take a while (let's say 5-10 seconds) to complete, this method returns a
   * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future} once the discovery process is completed and no Bridges can be found anymore.
   * As users may rightly get impatient while waiting, this method also takes a {@code Consumer<HueBridge>} as
   * an argument. This Consumer is called whenever a new Bridge is discovered at any time during the discovery process.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * The Consumer can be used, for example, to populate a list of Bridges for the end-user to choose from, while the
   * actual discovery process still continues in the background. If the Consumer is implemented properly, the result
   * of this method (List of HueBridge objects) can actually be discarded completely.
   * </p>
   *
   * @param bridgeDiscoverer A Consumer that is called whenever a new Bridge is encountered during
   *                         the discovery process. Even if multiple discovery methods are used the Consumer will only
   *                         be called once per Bridge, even if all the different methods would actually discover
   *                         the same Bridge independently.
   * @param discoveryMethods With this argument one can limit the methods being used. For example, if it is known
   *                         that this local network has no access to the outside internet, then one should not
   *                         try to use the NUPNP method in vain, but instead use just the MDNS method only.
   * @return A Future that is completed once the discovery processes have been finished.
   * As a result, the Future will hold a list of any and all Hue Bridges that were found,
   * ready to be given to the {@link io.github.zeroone3010.yahueapi.Hue#hueBridgeConnectionBuilder(String)}
   * method for establishing an authorized connection with the Bridge. If the {@code bridgeDiscoverer} Consumer is
   * implemented, this result can be safely ignored.
